## Important, if you wanna use this config

- Unfree packages allowed
- Change the user and home path accordingly, you're obviously not "j" (unless you are ig)
- `secret-thingy` is a local flake, it's a secret :3. Remove the input from `flake.nix` or add it and do whatever you want with it. If you decide to remove it make sure to remove `secret-thingy` from the outputs thing and the inherits thing
